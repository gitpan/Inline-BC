Inline::BC is an ILSM (Inline Support Language Module ) for Gnu bc, the arbitrary
precision numeric processing language.  Inline::BC - like other ILSMs - allows you
compile (well - render to byte code ), and run Gnu bc code within your Perl
program.

From the Gnu BC README:

bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language.  Syntax is
similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas.  It supports
interactive execution of statements.  bc is a utility included in the
POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.

This version was written to be a POSIX compliant bc processor with
several extensions to the draft standard.  Option flags are available
to cause warning or rejection of the extensions to the POSIX standard.
For those who want only POSIX bc with no extensions, a grammar is
provided for exactly the language described in the POSIX document.
The grammar (sbc.y) comes from the POSIX document.  The Makefile
contains rules to make sbc.  (for Standard BC)
